Tysen:
 Can add or delete team lead or team members.
 


#### Sujal:
 Full access to the schedules of team lead.
 

#### Armando:
Active status of team lead & team members (clocked in or clocked out?)
We spoke about Code review, Armando taking the team lead, we will each create modular functions in the chosen languages. Once the functions are created they will be reviewed by the group, and the decision to implement the code into the main code will be made.
Each day we will check slack, and work on good communication practices.

# Week 9 (Total Hours Spent 3.5 - 4.5)

### Progress:
- I created a User interface which contains an add or delete button, and the code is written in **HTML** and **CSS**. The page was based on my assigned task from week 8. The page has a design, and is coded for multiple sized screens. 

**Research**:
- I researched about HTML and CSS for refresher of the coding. 
- I spent some time watching videos provided by Armando about **DJANGO**
- 

### Challenges: 
- One challenge I faced was I do not know the languages DJANGO, SQLITE, or PYTHON. I find it very difficult for me to be able to program and contribute the the code, when I need to do extensive time and research to be able to contribute to this project effectively and efficiently. 
- My other courses homework is consuming much of my needed time to be able to spend the time needed, but I am committed to doing the best job I can on this project. 
- When I message on **Slack** I rarely get a reply from my group members, and I find it difficult to communicate, So this area can use immediate improvement. However, I will say that once in person and on the topic, we work well as a group. I feel that possibly we all are very consumed by homework and life challenges which is a factor. 


### My Plan: 
- As spoke about with Dibya my Instructor, we decided that I can focus on the Front end of the project, and the mock up. I do understand HTML and CSS much better at this time then PYTHON or DJANGO, so it was decided that my main focus could be on the front end of the project.
- I plan to create a mock up of the pages for the app. 
- I plan to Code some of the pages, according to the specific needs of each page.
- I plan to research and learn what I can about DJANGO and PYTHON. 
- I plan to make regular commits, and put in the time needed to play a large role in contributing to this project.

### Reference to Research:

### Group work: 
- A repository was created where we can contribute. 
- There has been some communication on Slack, but needs improvement.
