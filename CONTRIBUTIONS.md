### App Name: Gym Planner

### Languages: Python/JavaScript, SQLite, dJango

### Key Features of app:
#### Admin:
 Can add or delete team lead or team members.
 Full access to the schedules of team lead.
 Active status of team lead & team members (clocked in or clocked out?)
 

#### Team Lead (trainer):

#### Plan:
1. Create GitHub Repository,
2. Assign 3 tasks (one each),
3.  Establish the Key features of the app.
4. Choose group leader = Armando




#### Assigned Tasks:
Tysen:
 Can add or delete team lead or team members.
 


#### Sujal:
 Full access to the schedules of team lead.
 

#### Armando:
Active status of team lead & team members (clocked in or clocked out?)
We spoke about Code review, Armando taking the team lead, we will each create modular functions in the chosen languages. Once the functions are created they will be reviewed by the group, and the decision to implement the code into the main code will be made.
Each day we will check slack, and work on good communication practices.

# Week 9 (Total Hours Spent 3.5 - 4.5)

### Progress:
- I created a User interface which contains an add or delete button, and the code is written in **HTML** and **CSS**. The page was based on my assigned task from week 8. The page has a design, and is coded for multiple sized screens. 

**Research**:
- I researched about HTML and CSS for refresher of the coding. 
- I spent some time watching videos provided by Armando about **DJANGO**
 

### Challenges: 
- One challenge I faced was I do not know the languages DJANGO, SQLITE, or PYTHON. I find it very difficult for me to be able to program and contribute the the code, when I need to do extensive time and research to be able to contribute to this project effectively and efficiently. 
- My other courses homework is consuming much of my needed time to be able to spend the time needed, but I am committed to doing the best job I can on this project. 
- When I message on **Slack** I rarely get a reply from my group members, and I find it difficult to communicate, So this area can use immediate improvement. However, I will say that once in person and on the topic, we work well as a group. I feel that possibly we all are very consumed by homework and life challenges which is a factor. 


### My Plan: 
- As spoke about with Dibya my Instructor, we decided that I can focus on the Front end of the project, and the mock up. I do understand HTML and CSS much better at this time then PYTHON or DJANGO, so it was decided that my main focus could be on the front end of the project.
- I plan to create a mock up of the pages for the app. 
- I plan to Code some of the pages, according to the specific needs of each page.
- I plan to research and learn what I can about DJANGO and PYTHON. 
- I plan to make regular commits, and put in the time needed to play a large role in contributing to this project.

### Reference to Research:

### Group work: 
- A repository was created where we can contribute. 
- There has been some communication on Slack, but needs improvement.

# Week Week 10 (Total Hours Spent 4 Hours ) (More to be added this week)

### Progress:
- I have spent hours in research of html and css, and researching how to code for multiple screens, and  additionally researching about Django and Python. 
- I have forked the **GitHub Repository** and cloned this to my local machine, I then moved my files from an isolated folder over into my forked repository. 
- I researched how to use GitHub as my knowledge is limited on this topic. 
- In GitHub I **Created an Issue** to be able to communicate using github and to break the ice with my group and get more activity happening in the project. 
- Notified my group on slack of the Issue I have created. 
- We have spoke in slack about possible themes or colors involved in the project.


### Challenges: 
- Frequent communication has taken place on Slack with my group, but it has been difficult with this, as everyone does not answer very quickly. 
- Overloaded with homework has set me back a lot, and caused me to not have the time I need to focus ont his project as much as I would like. 


### My Plan: 
- My plan is to move all my files over to the forked group project.
- I will make a better effort of documenting on github using the issue I have created.
- I plan to create/ Complete all UI pages this week, with regular commits. 
- I would like to create a Mock up and mood board.

# Week 11 (Total Hours Spent 6 Hours) (More to be added this week)

### Progress:
- This week I re-created the user-management page to meet our teams themes and goals. 
- I went over the plan with Armando in class and I now have more to work with. 
- As part of this project I have been researching the different languages so as I go and will provide a few links to resources. 
- I looked at the pages that Sujal has created, and I am trying to create ones that we do not have yet.

### Challenges: 
- My largest obstacle is my other homework, I spent nearly 60 hours approx on my coding assignment for 114, and near the end I lost my entire project. 
- My next largest obstacle is communication with my team, we seem to have a very difficult time communicating, and I can tell it is picking up near the end of this course, but it has been very poor.
- I have been very eager to work on things, but I have felt stuck many times, because I do not understand the other codes, and it has thrown me off. 

### My Plan: 
- Now that I am beginning to finally catch up on some of my other courses, I plan to create a page everyday. 
- My hours put in will be fully accounted for and then some by the end of this course, and I realize I have not been able to complete a lot but the effort has been there.
